    <p>Hi! My name is Alex de Chazal.</p>
    <p>
        I built this website to better understand GitHub Pages and as placeholder content for my domain name. 
        It’s like an ‘About’ page on any normal website.
    </p>
    <p>
        I currently live in Jersey City, just across the Hudson river from New York City. 
        I’m a first generation Canadian citizen, my parents came from Mauritius and the UK.
    </p>

       I probably wanted to be a National Geographic Photographer in high-school but after doing an Economics 
        degree at Western University and three years in a small financial data vendor in Montreal I fell into 
        the Global Custody and Payments business (not something I had heard of in high-school). I then enjoyed 
        20 years at The Bank of New York Mellon, Standard Chartered Bank. I particularly enjoyed on-boarding new 
        clients and helping them get the most out of the bank’s new technology services. I also loved the 
        global side of Global Custody which allowed me to live in Singapore, Hong Kong and brought various 
        work assignments all over the world. 
    </p>

        After a refreshing career break in Switzerland I’m now looking to get back to work. It would be great 
        to hear from you so please reach out and say hi: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-de-chazal/">LinkedIn</a>.
    </p>
     <p>
        Outside of work I have many interests. I still maintain a love of photography <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chazal1/">(Instagram)</a>, big and small 
         adventures <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/40143916">(Strava)</a>, as well as cooking for my awesome family, reading, and staying current with 
         the latest technology developments.
